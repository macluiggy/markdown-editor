# Markdown Previewer
---
Hello there, I'm [Luiggy](https://github.com/macluiggy), welcome to my Markdown Previewer!

The project was built for learning purposes as a part of Front End Libraries Certification by freeCodeCamp.

You can find the challenge by clicking [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer)
How To Use It?
-------------------

1. Type something
2. The markdown will show the result on the left in HTML

That's it.  Pretty simple.

Why Markdown?
-------------

It's easy.  It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML.  Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

Ready to start writing? Then start changing stuff, have fun!
